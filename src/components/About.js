    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in the Philippines and later making the move to Canada in my 
        adolescence, my path has been anything but direct. 
        Initially exploring the world of fashion design, I discovered my true passion 
        lay elsewhere. Today, I stand proud as a software developer, 
        dedicated to building useful and engaging projects that make a difference. 
        When I'm not coding, or hunched over like the hunchback of Notredame, I find joy and balance in salsa dancing. 
    </p>
